# Derek Christensen

Hello, GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Derek Christensen, a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho interested in web development and ML. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

Somewhere around 2019 I was introduced to programming through Khan Academy where I would build simple games with JavaScript. Since then, I have expanded my programming knowledge through classes at BYU-Idaho, courses on Codecademy, and by just experimenting with different languages and libraries.

Currently I'm currently working on programming a hexapod robot that will leverage Computer Vision for navigation and interaction, so I am learning about Computer Vision from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn).

I am always open to working on new projects, and I am sometimes working 3+ on multiple projects at the same time.
